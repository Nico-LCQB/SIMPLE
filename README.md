These R scripts (SIMPLE_Neutral.R and SIMPLE_Transient.R) simulates the appearance of 2 types of mutations in an exponentially growing yeast population starting from a single cell. The simulation can be performed either in the absence (null model with SIMPLE_Neutral.R) or in the presence (refined model with SIMPLE_Transient.R) of a subpopulation of transient mutator cells. For both models, the number of generations and the values of the two single mutation rates are chosen by the user. For the refined model, the size of the mutator subpopulation, the fold-change of the mutation rates and the duration of the mutator episode (in generations) are also defined by the user. The output provides the number of both single and double mutant cells in the final colony and the number of mutations that occurred during the colony development.
